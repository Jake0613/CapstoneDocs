# Capstone
Android capstone project for Professor Kreider at Christopher Newport University Spring Semester 2018. This android app will combine an exercise tracking app with gaming to create an app that will motivate or provide enjoyment to people who are lacking them when it comes to exercising. The app will also, if the user allows, store their exercising data on a central database that health insurance agencies can access to order to deem if their customer is elgible for rewards or discounts based off of their exercising habits.
